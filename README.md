# FdF
FdF is a project inside the 42 Common core. It consists on the developing of a topographic map visualizer using C and the (very limited) MiniLibX graphic library.

## Files:
FdF maps should be described in a plain text file where any point in the map is written as a number, separated with spaces in a grid.
### For example this map:
